**ReOpenAL** is a client-side MinecraftForge mod that adds a means to restart the Minecraft sound system without having to reload all mod resource packs.

This is useful if the Minecraft sound system fails to start with OpenAL during startup, leaving the game running in 'silent mode'.

Simply enter the sound options GUI __(*Options* -> *Music and Sounds*)__ and **ReOpenAL** will attempt to restart the sound system with OpenAL.

**ReOpenAL** is compatible with Minecraft versions from **1.9** to **1.12.2**.
